Welcome! I'm Ana Zappa, a postdoctoral Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at the University of Barcelona. My research focuses on second language (L2) learning, adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates psycholinguistic and social cognitive perspectives. Specifically, I examine how action and social interaction shapes the formation of lexicosemantic representations.

To achieve this, I use a combination of electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, pupillometry, and behavioral measures to examine the neural, psychophysiological, and behavioral correlates of L2 word learning across diverse learning contexts. I use virtual reality to create interactive, immersive social environments that strike a balance between ecological validity and experimental control.
