I'm Ana Zappa, a postdoctoral Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow working at the University of Barcelona. My research centers around second langauge learning, with a psycholinguistic and social cognitive approach. I'm particularly interested in how social interaction shapes second language learning, with a focus on lexicosemantic learning. I combine electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, pupillometry and behavior to measure the neural, psychophysiological and behavioral corelates of second language word learning in different learning contexts. I use virtual reality to create interactive, immersive social settings, while maintaining experimental control.
